March 7
- Created git/Github repository with capability of pushing to/pulling from repo
- Allowed for selectivity of variables representing pitch types, contacts
- Added basic filter functionality for pitch types, contacts to scatterplot creation

- Implemented all five of the ggplot types (errors indicate statistical malpractice)
- Added save/export functionality with custom titles, captions (see Test1.png for ex.)

// Scraped Data -> Engineered Data Pipeline, Part 1 //
- Given an unmodified file (i.e., that which has been scraped):
- Functions implemented to create IDs and Contact States from USER-SPECIFIED VARIABLES
  - Fixed overwrite issue where two buttons would undo the other's work
- Added export to .csv for the added columns so that users did not have to repeat steps, 
  if unnecessary 
  
// To-Do: Implement Markov Transition Matrix function(s) from Project, give Tab for this
// To-Do: Include FILTER BY PLAYER option --> have this automatically update other filters
// To-Do: Create custom ggplot theme that can be a signature of created plots w/in app

March 8
- Fixed bug where "un-edited" dataset (i.e., changes done externally from application)
  would not elicit response from filter.
  
- Fixed bug where changed filter had defaulted to False values, meaning that if no
  specification occurred w.r.t. filters, plots would show as empty if the filters were checked.
- In tandem with the above item, switched filters to default value of TRUE, as it does not change anything if the user de-selects them -- only causes change when the filter itself is changed.

March 14
(Happy Pi Day!)
- Created Markov Tab
- Began working on gt Output -- works with unspecified dimensions; params overwrite when passed correctly, act fine otherwise.
// To-Do: Specify gt Output dimensions
// To-Do: Add TextInputs for information about the graphic
// To-Do: Find way to automatically throw output to web broswer window

March 15
- Played around with tabsetPanel UI for Markov Tab
// To-Do: Utilize tabsetPanel UI for other tabs -- nicer to work with; more aesthetically pleasing
// To-Do: Include raw text output that lets user know where the .html, .csv(s) have been saved.

March 22 
- Updated UI on Edit Dataset tab to tabsetPanel, tabPanel system
// To-Do: Include raw text output for buttons that let users know the changes can be viewed    
          in 'View Edited Dataset' tab
