// Scraped Data -> Engineered Data Pipeline, Part 1 //
- Given an unmodified file (i.e., that which has been scraped):
- Functions implemented to create IDs and Contact States from USER-SPECIFIED VARIABLES
  - Fixed overwrite issue where two buttons would undo the other's work
- Added export to .csv for the added columns so that users did not have to repeat steps, 
  if unnecessary 
  
// To-Do: Implement Markov Transition Matrix function(s) from Project, give Tab for this
// To-Do: Include FILTER BY PLAYER option --> have this automatically update other filters
// To-Do: Create custom ggplot theme that can be a signature of created plots w/in app
