March 7
- Created git/Github repository with capability of pushing to/pulling from repo
- Allowed for selectivity of variables representing pitch types, contacts
- Added basic filter functionality for pitch types, contacts to scatterplot creation

- Implemented all five of the ggplot types (errors indicate statistical malpractice)
- Added save/export functionality with custom titles, captions (see Test1.png for ex.)

// Scraped Data -> Engineered Data Pipeline, Part 1 //
- Given an unmodified file (i.e., that which has been scraped):
- Functions implemented to create IDs and Contact States from USER-SPECIFIED VARIABLES
  - Fixed overwrite issue where two buttons would undo the other's work
- Added export to .csv for the added columns so that users did not have to repeat steps, 
  if unnecessary 
  
// To-Do: Implement Markov Transition Matrix function(s) from Project, give Tab for this
// To-Do: Include FILTER BY PLAYER option --> have this automatically update other filters
// To-Do: Create custom ggplot theme that can be a signature of created plots w/in app

March 8
- Fixed bug where "un-edited" dataset (i.e., changes done externally from application)
  would not elicit response from filter.
  
- Fixed bug where changed filter had defaulted to False values, meaning that if no
  specification occurred w.r.t. filters, plots would show as empty if the filters were checked.
- In tandem with the above item, switched filters to default value of TRUE, as it does not change anything if the user de-selects them -- only causes change when the filter itself is changed.

March 14
(Happy Pi Day!)
- Created Markov Tab
- Began working on gt Output -- works with unspecified dimensions; params overwrite when passed correctly, act fine otherwise.
// To-Do: Specify gt Output dimensions
// To-Do: Add TextInputs for information about the graphic
// To-Do: Find way to automatically throw output to web broswer window

March 15
- Played around with tabsetPanel UI for Markov Tab
// To-Do: Utilize tabsetPanel UI for other tabs -- nicer to work with; more aesthetically pleasing
// To-Do: Include raw text output that lets user know where the .html, .csv(s) have been saved.

March 22 
- Updated UI on Edit Dataset tab to tabsetPanel, tabPanel system
// To-Do: Include raw text output for buttons that let users know the changes can be viewed    
          in 'View Edited Dataset' tab

March 23 
// Note: As of this date, these changes are not on Github. It's not final, and I'm still 
// working on testing kinks and other bugs in it.
- Started working with a Trackman-based dataset
- Added boolean to import tab to note a Trackman-derived dataset --> used in ID creation
- Got the ID creation to work with data of a different source

// To-Do: Derive a way to create user-specified "presets" for the editing tab so that 
users don't need to re-select the same variables... every import.

March 24
- Finalized baseline MarkovDev stuff, merged branch to master in Github, repo.
- Added pitcher filtering (may change this to dropdown later)

// To-Do: Give the filter checkboxes in 'Plots' their own places in the 'Filter Dataset' tab
// To-Do: Add preset functionality (may make a branch for this).

April 18
(It's been a minute. :/)
- Implemented Presets for many of the crucial variables needed for raw TM data.
   - Users now do not need to repeatedly select variables for different TM files, just toggle 
     a checkbox.
Note: Other projects, such as a team-wide scouting report for pitchers and opponents' pitchers, have been at the forefront of recent work. These concepts should eventually make their way here (and to the Terminal!), so accommodating them will be important!

// To-Do: W.r.t. old entries: RAW TEXT OUTPUTS and Moving Plots' Filters to Filter tab
// To-Do: Integrate scouting report stuff in here -- wait for that to be independently developed a bit more.
