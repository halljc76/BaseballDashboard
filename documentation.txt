March 7
- Created git/Github repository with capability of pushing to/pulling from repo
- Allowed for selectivity of variables representing pitch types, contacts
- Added basic filter functionality for pitch types, contacts to scatterplot creation

- Implemented all five of the ggplot types (errors indicate statistical malpractice)
- Added save/export functionality with custom titles, captions (see Test1.png for ex.)

// Scraped Data -> Engineered Data Pipeline, Part 1 //
- Given an unmodified file (i.e., that which has been scraped):
- Functions implemented to create IDs and Contact States from USER-SPECIFIED VARIABLES
  - Fixed overwrite issue where two buttons would undo the other's work
- Added export to .csv for the added columns so that users did not have to repeat steps, 
  if unnecessary 
  
// To-Do: Implement Markov Transition Matrix function(s) from Project, give Tab for this
// To-Do: Include FILTER BY PLAYER option --> have this automatically update other filters
// To-Do: Create custom ggplot theme that can be a signature of created plots w/in app

March 8
- Fixed bug where "un-edited" dataset (i.e., changes done externally from application)
  would not elicit response from filter.
  
- Fixed bug where changed filter had defaulted to False values, meaning that if no
  specification occurred w.r.t. filters, plots would show as empty if the filters were checked.
- In tandem with the above item, switched filters to default value of TRUE, as it does not change anything if the user de-selects them -- only causes change when the filter itself is changed.

// To-Do: To remove dependency on Jmisc package for sourcing from Functions folder, make a PACKAGE that contains all of the included functions, with documentation.
